- This workflow aligns with academic integrity and reproducibility standards at Dakota State University.
- Could be used to figure out the accuracy of weather prediction.
- Potential risks (bias, privacy, security)
  - There are multiple methods for figuring out weather data. This one could be biased towards a certain method.
- Mitigations (data handling, bias checks)
  - Could add more endpoints to diversify the methods for weather prediction from other sources.
- Limitations (known constraints)
  - Can only see the next 5 days of forecast data
